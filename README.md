# CS310-FlutterProject-SocialMediaApp

This project is done by group of 3 people. So, it is not my project entirely.

The project is basicly a social app which is mixture of instagram and twitter.

FireBase - FireStore was used as a database. Currently it is not avaliable. So, data related fields are not working, instead they are displayed as loading... .

I implemented
- login page and functions
- register  and functions
- firebase database implementation
- profile page edit and upload profile picture from device
- notification page and functions
- feed page and post cards.
